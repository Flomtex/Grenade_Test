# Do You Want to Make a Game?

A short, creepy particle explosion demo using Python and Pygame.

Click anywhere to spawn a pulsing grenade orb. After a few seconds, it explodes into drifting particles. Each particle leaves a smoke trail and eventually bursts again in a flash, releasing a cloud of smoke. The whole effect plays out over a creepy doll background image — perfect for visual demos or shortform content.
